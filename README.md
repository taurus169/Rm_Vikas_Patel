# Detecting Hate Speech on Twitter
<p>Detection of hate speeches on twitter can be done with the help of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. ML and NLP algorithms are based on statistical methods they are fed training data and from that data model learns repetitively and at last the testing data is tested on the model that is learned. Accuracy may vary on basis of different algorithms and datasets used.</p>
<p>Here we have used three different algorithms for detecting hate speech on twitter. It is found that Support Vector Machine gives an accuracy score of 0.944 with the dataset used here. Here the data is split 70:30 for training and testing respectively. It's worth noting that Logistic Regression produced excellent results as well with an accuracy score of 0.940.</p>
<h2> Dataset: </h2>
<p>Hate-speech detection was studied using a dataset based on Twitter data. Hate-speech, offensive language, and neither are the classifications for the data. It's crucial to highlight that this dataset contains language that might be deemed racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise objectionable due to the nature of the study. </p>

<h2> Here we have used three machine learning algorithms:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Naive Bayes:</b> Naive Bayes are a group of supervised machine learning classification algorithms based on the Bayes theorem. It's a basic classification method with high functionality. Gaussian Naive Bayes is a Naive Bayes version that uses a Gaussian normal distribution and can handle continuous data.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Support Vector Machine:</b> Support Vector Machine is a supervised machine learning method that can be used for classification and regression. Support Vector Machines are based on the concept of determining the optimal hyperplane for dividing a dataset into two groups.</p></li>![Svm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66897930/129128570-f55eb156-ea3d-4e47-95a3-fb80665575cf.png)
<li><p><b>Logistic Regression:</b> Logistic Regression is a predictive method that uses independent factors to predict the dependent variable, where the dependent variable must be a categorical variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables with the output.</p></li>
